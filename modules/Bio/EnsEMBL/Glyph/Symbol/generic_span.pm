=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Glyph::Symbol::generic_span

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Superclass for drawing spans - two-headed arrows, anchored arrows, h-bars, etc
Inheritors should implement start_symbol, end_symbol,top_symbol, bottom_symbol

=head1 ATTRIBS

- bar_style : how to draw the connecting bar.  Default can be different for each
subclass.  One of:
    - line
    - indent
    - full
